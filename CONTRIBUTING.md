# Contributing to DebOps

As of 2017, the DebOps developers [decided to keep all of the DebOps development in one Git tree][monorepo-move]
(an approach called a "monorepo"). Therefore, please do not contribute here.
Please contribute instead in the [debops/debops][debops-monorepo] repository.

Thank you :)
